# CubicThon
A simple game made my me as a personal learning project. This is a simple obstacle avoiding game that has some environment and basic physics. Try not to collide with
any obstacle as the level will be reset. Also don't fall off the map!
Controls are: A and D for moving side to side; that's all you need to know to finish all the three levels. I intentionally made the third level a bit harder so good luck.
Have fun!
